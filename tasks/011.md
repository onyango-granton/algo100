Day 13 (Feb 16): Sort an Array using Insertion Sort
Problem Statement:

Implement Insertion Sort, a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm that builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting each element into its correct position.
Example 1:

Input: [7, 4, 5, 2]  
Output: [2, 4, 5, 7]  

Example 2:

Input: [10, 1, 3, 8]  
Output: [1, 3, 8, 10]  

Constraints:

    The input array contains integers only.
    Try implementing both iterative and recursive versions of Insertion Sort.
