Problem Statement:

Implement the Binary Search algorithm. Given a sorted array and a target value, determine if the target exists in the array. If found, return its index; otherwise, return -1.
Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1, 0, 3, 5, 9, 12], target = 9  
Output: 4  
Explanation: 9 is at index 4.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1, 0, 3, 5, 9, 12], target = 2  
Output: -1  
Explanation: 2 is not present in the array.

Constraints:

    The array is sorted in ascending order.
    Implement both iterative and recursive approaches.
    Can you achieve O(log n) time complexity? ðŸš€
