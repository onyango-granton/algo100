Write a function that takes two arrays as input and returns their union. The union of two arrays includes all unique elements from both arrays.

Example:

Input: arr1 = [1, 2, 3], arr2 = [2, 3, 4]  
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

Input: arr1 = [5, 10, 15], arr2 = [10, 20, 30]  
Output: [5, 10, 15, 20, 30]

You can modify it based on the language youâ€™re working with! ðŸš€
