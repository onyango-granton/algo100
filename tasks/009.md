Problem Statement:

Given a sorted array of integers nums and a target value, find the first and last position of the target in the array. If the target is not found, return [-1, -1].
Example 1:

Input: nums = [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10], target = 8  
Output: [3, 4]  
Explanation: The number 8 appears from index 3 to 4.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10], target = 6  
Output: [-1, -1]  
Explanation: 6 is not present in the array.

Constraints:

    The array is sorted in ascending order.
    Can you solve it in O(log n) time complexity using Binary Search? ðŸš€
