Problem Statement:

Given a set of distinct integers, write a function that returns all possible subsets (the power set). The solution should not contain duplicate subsets, and the order of subsets does not matter.
Example 1:
Input:

nums = [1, 2, 3]

Output:

[[], [1], [2], [3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3]]

Example 2:
Input:

nums = [0]

Output:

[[], [0]]

Constraints:

    1≤1≤ length of nums ≤10≤10
    −10≤−10≤ each element in nums ≤10≤10
    All elements in nums are unique.

Follow-up Challenge:

Can you solve this problem both iteratively and recursively?
