Problem Statement:Given a string, write a function to determine if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

Example 1:

Input: "racecar"
Output: True

Example 2:

Input: "hello"
Output: False

Constraints:

The input string contains only printable ASCII characters.

Can you solve it in O(n) time complexity?
