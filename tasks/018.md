Two Sum Problem
Problem Statement

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

Constraints:

    Each input has exactly one solution.
    You may not use the same element twice.

Example Input & Output:

Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9  
Output: [0, 1]  (Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9)

Input: nums = [3, 2, 4], target = 6  
Output: [1, 2]  

Challenge: Can you solve this problem efficiently in O(n) time complexity?
