Question for Day 1 (Feb 4): Reverse an Array:

Question:
Given an array of integers, write a function to reverse the array in place, meaning you should modify the original array without using extra space for another array.

Example:

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

Constraints:

    The function should run in O(n) time complexity.
    You cannot use built-in reverse functions.
