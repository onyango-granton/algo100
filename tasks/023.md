Tower of Hanoi Problem

The Tower of Hanoi is a classic recursive problem involving moving disks between rods.
Problem Statement

You have three rods and n disks of different sizes. Initially, all disks are stacked on the first rod in decreasing order (largest at the bottom, smallest at the top).

Your task is to move all the disks from the first rod to the third rod following these rules:

    You can move only one disk at a time.
    A disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.
    You can use the second rod as an auxiliary.

Example

For n = 3, the steps would be:

Move disk 1 from A to C  
Move disk 2 from A to B  
Move disk 1 from C to B  
Move disk 3 from A to C  
Move disk 1 from B to A  
Move disk 2 from B to C  
Move disk 1 from A to C  

Challenge

ðŸ‘‰ Implement a recursive function tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination) to solve this problem for any n.
