Problem Statement:
Given an array and an integer k, rotate the array to the right by k positions.

Example 1:
python
Copy
Edit
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], k = 3  
Output: [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]  
Example 2:
python
Copy
Edit
Input: nums = [-1, -100, 3, 99], k = 2  
Output: [3, 99, -1, -100]  
Constraints:
Try solving it in O(n) time complexity.
Can you do it in-place, without using extra space?
