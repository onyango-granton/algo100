Problem Statement: Factorial of a Number using Recursion

Write a function that takes a non-negative integer n and returns its factorial using recursion.
Example 1

ğŸ“Œ Input: n = 5
ğŸ“Œ Output: 120
ğŸ“Œ Explanation: 5! = 5 Ã— 4 Ã— 3 Ã— 2 Ã— 1 = 120
Example 2

ğŸ“Œ Input: n = 3
ğŸ“Œ Output: 6
ğŸ“Œ Explanation: 3! = 3 Ã— 2 Ã— 1 = 6
Constraints

    0 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 20 (to avoid integer overflow)
    Must use recursion
    Factorial of 0 is 1
