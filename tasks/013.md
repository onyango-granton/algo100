Problem Statement:

You are given an array containing n-1 distinct numbers from the range 1 to n. Your task is to find the missing number.
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]  
Output: 3  

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3, 7, 1, 2, 8, 4, 5]  
Output: 6  

Constraints:

    The input array contains unique numbers from 1 to n with one missing.
    Solve in O(n) time complexity.
    Can you solve it without using extra space? ðŸš€
