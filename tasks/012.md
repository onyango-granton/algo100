Problem Statement:

Given two sorted arrays, merge them into a single sorted array without using extra space (if possible).
Example 1:

Input: arr1 = [1, 3, 5], arr2 = [2, 4, 6]  
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  

Example 2:

Input: arr1 = [0, 7, 8], arr2 = [1, 2, 3]  
Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8]  

Constraints:

    Both arrays are already sorted in ascending order.
    Try solving the problem in O(n + m) time complexity, where n and m are the sizes of the two arrays.
    Can you optimize the solution to merge in place without using extra space? ðŸš€
