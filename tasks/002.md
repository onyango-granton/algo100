Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers, write a function to find the maximum and minimum values in the array.

Example 1:

Input: [3, 1, 5, 9, 2]
Output: (9, 1)

Example 2:

Input: [-10, 34, 2, 0, 99, -50]
Output: (99, -50)

Constraints:

    The array is non-empty.
    The numbers can be positive, negative, or zero.

Follow-up Questions:

    Can you solve it in O(n) time complexity?
    Can you find both values in a single traversal?
