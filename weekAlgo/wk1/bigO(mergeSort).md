The provided code implements the merge sort algorithm, which consists of two main functions: `divide` and `conquer`. 

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the merge sort algorithm is O(n log n). This is because the algorithm divides the input array into two halves recursively (which takes log n time), and then it merges the two halves in linear time (O(n)). The division continues until the base case is reached (arrays of size 1), leading to a total of log n levels of recursion, with each level requiring O(n) time to merge the arrays.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the merge sort algorithm is O(n). This is due to the additional space required to store the merged arrays during the merging process. The `conquer` function creates a new array (`mainArr`) that holds the combined elements of the left and right subarrays, which requires space proportional to the size of the input array. Additionally, the recursive calls also consume stack space, but the dominant factor in space complexity is the space used for merging. 

In summary, the time complexity is O(n log n) and the space complexity is O(n).
