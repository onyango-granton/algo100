Code Review (Rating: 7.5/10)
Your findFirstNonRepeating function is efficient and concise, but there are a few issues related to correctness, readability, and edge cases.

✅ Strengths:
Logical Approach – Uses a map to store indices of each character, then finds the smallest index of a non-repeating character.
Efficient Lookup – Checking character occurrences in O(n) time is optimal for this problem.
Minimal Code – Clean implementation with no unnecessary loops.
