2️⃣ Find the First Non-Repeating Character (Medium)
Problem: Given a string s, find the first character that appears only once. If no such character exists, return -1.
Example:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
Input: s = "leetcode"  
Output: "l"
✅ Concept: Use a hashmap to count character frequencies, then iterate to find the first unique character.
