Your implementation is correct and efficiently reverses the array in-place using the two-pointer approach. Here‚Äôs my honest feedback:
‚úÖ Strengths of Your Code

    In-Place Reversal (O(1) Extra Space) ‚Äì You don‚Äôt create an extra array; instead, you modify the original list, which is memory-efficient.
    Time Complexity is O(n) ‚Äì The function swaps elements only once while iterating half the list, making it optimal.
    Readable and Concise ‚Äì The variable names (leftPointer, rightPointer) are descriptive and easy to understand.

‚ö†Ô∏è Possible Improvements

    Use Pythonic Syntax (More Readable Alternative)
    Python allows a more elegant way to reverse lists using slicing:

def reverseArr(arr):
    return arr[::-1]

This is concise but creates a new list, while your approach modifies the original list.

Shorter Two-Pointer Alternative
If you want to keep the two-pointer approach but make it cleaner, you can use a while-else loop for clarity:

    def reverseArr(arr):
        left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
        while left < right:
            arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]
            left, right = left + 1, right - 1  # Increment & Decrement
        return arr

        Removed the redundant variable naming.
        More concise and clean while keeping functionality the same.

Final Verdict

Your implementation is correct, efficient, and well-structured. You can improve readability slightly, but functionally, it is great for LeetCode-style problems. üöÄüî•
