Your implementation effectively finds the intersection of two arrays using merge sort for sorting and a two-pointer technique for comparison. However, there are some improvements you can make for readability, efficiency, and correctness.
Key Improvements
1. Use More Descriptive Function Names

    divide → mergeSort
    conquer → merge
    compareArr → findIntersectionSorted

This makes it clearer that the first two functions are performing merge sort, and the last function is finding the intersection.
2. Avoid Redundant Code in compareArr

    The two conditional blocks (if len(sortedArrOne) < len(sortedArrTwo) {...} else {...}) are identical, except for swapping sortedArrOne and sortedArrTwo.
    Instead, remove the duplication by ensuring arrOne is always the smaller array and iterating normally.

3. Simplify Conditional Statements

    Instead of checking len(resArr) - 1 < 0, just check len(resArr) == 0.
    Instead of manually ensuring unique elements, use set-like logic.

4. Improve Merge Sort Implementation

    Currently, divide is recursive but could be optimized with an iterative merge sort to reduce function calls.
