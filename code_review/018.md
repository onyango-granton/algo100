Here’s a code review for your twoSum function, highlighting issues, inefficiencies, and suggestions for improvement:

Issues & Improvements:
1. Incorrect Index Mapping
You're modifying arr by sorting it (mergeSort(arr)), which disrupts the original indexes. However, later, you return lpointer and rpointer, which now point to the sorted array's indexes, not the original ones.
Fix: Use a structure to store the original indices before sorting, e.g., []struct{val, idx int}.

2. Incorrect Map Usage
You create a map[int]bool but populate it incorrectly:
go
Copy
Edit
for i := range arr {
    intMap[i] = false
}
This assigns false to array indexes, not the values.
Fix: Use map[int]bool to track used values instead: go intMap[arr[i]] = false

3. Incorrect Pointer Updates
When arr[lpointer] + arr[rpointer] > target, your if condition:
go
Copy
Edit
if arr[lpointer] > target && lpointer-1 >= 0 {
    lpointer--
} else {
    rpointer--
}
This is unnecessary and incorrect; the standard two-pointer approach simply decrements rpointer.
Fix: Just decrement rpointer when sum is greater, and increment lpointer when sum is smaller.

4. Merge Sort Inefficiency
You're using mergeSort(arr), which is O(n log n) time complexity. Instead, use Go’s built-in sort.Slice() (also O(n log n) but cleaner).
5. Returning Sorted Indexes Instead of Original
Since sorting changes positions, lpointer and rpointer no longer represent correct indices from the original array.
You should store original indices in a struct before sorting
