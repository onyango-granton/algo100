Code Review: Recursive Factorial Function
✅ Strengths:

    Correctness – The function correctly implements the factorial calculation using recursion.
    Base Case Handling – It properly handles the base case (num == 0 returning 1).
    Simplicity – The implementation is concise and easy to read.

⚠️ Potential Issues / Improvements:

    Integer Overflow Risk – Since factorial(num - 1) multiplies large values, an int in Go (usually 32 or 64-bit) may overflow for num > 20.
        🔧 Fix: Use uint64 or check for overflow conditions.
    Performance Consideration – Recursive calls create additional function calls in memory (stack frames).
        🔧 Fix: Iterative factorial avoids recursion depth issues.

Final Rating: 9/10 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

    ✅ Efficient for small values
    ⚠️ Risky for large values (overflow, recursion depth)
    💡 Consider an iterative approach for performance & safety
