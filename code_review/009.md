Issues & Improvements:

    Incorrect Initial Values for first and last
        The function findFirstAndLast receives first and last as parameters but doesn't initialize them properly.
        Instead of passing 0,0, it's better to set them to -1 inside the function.

    Handling Edge Cases in findFirstAndLast
        If binarySort returns -1, the function still tries to access arr[position], which will cause an error if the target is not in the list.
        A check should be added to return [-1, -1] if position == -1.

    Out-of-Bounds Access in the while Loops
        The while loops may cause an index out of range error if position moves beyond the array bounds.
        Add boundary checks: position >= 0 for left traversal and positionCopy < len(arr) for right traversal.

    Better Function Naming
        binarySort should be renamed to binarySearch since it performs a search, not sorting.

    Code Efficiency
        binarySearch already finds one occurrence of target, but the loops in findFirstAndLast traverse again. This could be optimized using binary search for both left and right bounds.
