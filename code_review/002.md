Your function is well-structured and correctly finds both the maximum and minimum values in a slice of integers. However, I have a few suggestions for improvement:
Pros:

✅ Correct Logic – The function correctly iterates through the slice and updates max and min accordingly.
✅ Concise & Readable – The function is easy to understand and uses idiomatic Go.
✅ Efficient – It runs in O(n) time complexity, which is optimal for this task.
Issues & Suggestions:

    Potential Panic on Empty Slice
        If arr is empty, arr[0] will cause a runtime panic.
        Fix: Add a length check at the start of the function.

    Misleading Variable Name (ch)
        ch is typically used for characters, whereas num or val would be more appropriate.

Improved Code:

func findMaxMin(arr []int) ([]int, error) {
	if len(arr) == 0 {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("slice is empty")
	}

	max, min := arr[0], arr[0]
	for _, num := range arr[1:] { // Start from index 1 since we initialized with arr[0]
		if num > max {
			max = num
		}
		if num < min {
			min = num
		}
	}
	return []int{max, min}, nil
}

Changes & Fixes:

✔ Handles Empty Slice – Returns an error instead of panicking.
✔ Better Variable Naming – Changed ch to num for clarity.
✔ Slight Optimization – Starts loop from arr[1:] since arr[0] is already assigned.
