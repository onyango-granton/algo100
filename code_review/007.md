Your rotateArr function has a few issues that can be improved:
Issues:

Off-by-One Error: The slicing logic does not correctly handle rotations. When positions=3, the function does not properly move elements.
Inefficient Copying: You are copying the entire array into copyArr, but there's a more efficient way to rotate the array.
Extra Looping: The approach uses two loops to manually shift elements, which is unnecessary in Python.
Doesn't Handle Negative Rotations: If positions is negative, the function should rotate in the opposite direction.
Modular Indexing: If positions is greater than len(arr), the function should adjust it.
