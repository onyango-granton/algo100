Your Python implementation of Insertion Sort is mostly correct, but I have a few suggestions for improvement in terms of clarity, efficiency, and best practices.
Code Review & Suggestions
1. range(0, len(arr)) can be simplified

    range(0, len(arr)) is redundant since range(len(arr)) does the same thing.

2. Meaningful variable names

    x can be renamed to i (common loop variable name).
    pointer can be renamed to j (conventional for tracking the current element being shifted).

3. Slight improvement in readability

    The while condition is correct (pointer - 1 >= 0), but it can be written as pointer > 0 for better readability.
