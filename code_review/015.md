Your Go implementation of Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm is functionally correct, but there are a few improvements for readability and efficiency. Hereâ€™s my review:
âœ… Strengths:

    Correct Algorithm â€“ The logic correctly follows Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum.
    Efficient O(n) Complexity â€“ Iterates through the array only once.
    Proper Initialization â€“ Initializes maxSum and sum correctly.

ðŸ›  Suggested Improvements:

    Use max() Instead of if-else for Readability
        Instead of manually checking conditions, use Goâ€™s math.Max() for concise code.

    Improve Variable Naming
        sum could be renamed to currentSum to make it clearer.
