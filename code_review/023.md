Your tower_of_hanoi function is mostly correct but could use some minor improvements for readability and clarity. Hereâ€™s a review:
Issues and Improvements:

    Base Case Clarity
        Instead of if n == 0: return, it's better to use if n <= 0: return to ensure invalid inputs (e.g., n < 0) are safely handled.

    Comment Clarity
        The comment # auxiliary somewhat of the waiting,bay is unclear. Consider rewording it to:
        # The auxiliary rod serves as temporary storage during the move.

    Formatting for Readability
        Instead of print("Move", n, "from ", source, "to", destination), use an f-string for better readability:

    print(f"Move disk {n} from {source} to {destination}")

Variable Naming

    While source, auxiliary, and destination are standard in Tower of Hanoi, you might consider more intuitive names like start, temp, and end, but this is optional.
