Your recursive function moveToLast attempts to move all zeros to the end of an array while maintaining the order of non-zero elements. Hereâ€™s a detailed review:

Issues & Improvements:
Out-of-Bounds Access

When index == len(arr), you set arr[nonZeroPointer] = 0, but this may not be safe since nonZeroPointer could already be len(arr).
Your base case should return arr immediately when index == len(arr), avoiding unnecessary assignments.
Extra Recursive Calls

The function calls itself even after reaching the end, which is unnecessary. You should return immediately when index == len(arr).
Handling Zeros Correctly

The function moves non-zero elements forward but doesn't explicitly push zeros to the end after all non-zero elements are placed.
