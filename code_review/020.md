Issues and Improvements
1. Incorrect Start Index Update
Problem:

go
Copy
Edit
start = j
sum = 0
Updating start = j inside the loop resets the start index, leading to incorrect subarray ranges.
Example issue: For {6, -1, -3, 4, -2, 2, 4, 6, -12, -7}, expected output should include (start: 1, stop: 5), but it might break.
Fix:
Remove start = j, as start should always be i for the current iteration.

2. Inefficient Brute Force Approach (O(n²))
Problem:

The nested loop approach results in O(n²) complexity.
This is fine for small arrays but inefficient for larger ones.
Fix: Use Hash Map for O(n) Solution

Track cumulative sums using a map:
If a sum repeats, it means elements in between sum to zero.
This eliminates the need for the nested loop.
3. Return Consistency
Problem:

You return 1-based stop index (stop+1), but Go conventionally uses 0-based indexing.
This could cause confusion when used with Go's slicing.
Fix:

Keep stop as zero-based to match Go's slice conventions.
