Your Python implementation of binary search has a small mistake in the base case condition and logic. Let's go through the fixes.
Issues in Your Code:

    Incorrect stop Index in Function Call:

print(binarySort([2,4,5,6,7,8,10],4,0,7))

    The array has 7 elements, and valid indices are 0 to 6.
    You passed stop = 7, which is out of bounds.
    Fix: Use stop = len(arr) - 1.

Missing Check for When target == arr[midIndex]:

if target > arr[midIndex]:

    If target == arr[midIndex], the function should return midIndex.
    Your code never returns the correct index when the target is found.
