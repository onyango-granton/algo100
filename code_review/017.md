Your function works, but it has some inefficiencies. Below is a review and suggested improvements.
Issues & Improvements:
1️⃣ Inefficient Sorting (O(n log n))

    Sorting the array using mergeSort makes the overall complexity O(n log n).
    A more optimal approach would use a hash set to achieve O(n) complexity.

2️⃣ Unnecessary 2D Slice (listArr is Redundant)

    Instead of storing all sequences, we only need to track the longest sequence length.

3️⃣ Edge Case Handling

    What if arr is empty? The function will panic at sortedArr[0].
