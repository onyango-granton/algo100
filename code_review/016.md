Your function correctly identifies the index of the first non-repeating character in a given string. Below is a detailed review with improvements:
Issues & Suggested Improvements

    Variable Naming
        charDic â†’ Rename to char_dict for better readability.
        index â†’ Rename to min_index to clarify its purpose.

    Use of range(len(word))
        Instead of range(len(word)), you can iterate directly over enumerate(word), which provides both the index and the character.

    Unnecessary Condition in Final if Statement
        The condition if index >= 0 and index < len(word): can be simplified to just if index < len(word):.

    Better Handling of Default Value
        Instead of initializing index = len(word), use float('inf'), which is a more conventional way to track a minimum value.
