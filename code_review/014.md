Your function is logically correct, but there are some improvements you can make for better readability, efficiency, and idiomatic Go style.
Issues & Improvements:

    Unnecessary Comparison (numMap[ch] == false)
        Instead of explicitly checking if numMap[ch] == false, just use if !numMap[ch] for better readability.

    Inefficient append(arr1, arr2...)
        append(arr1, arr2...) creates a new slice by copying elements, which increases memory usage. Instead, iterate separately over arr1 and arr2.

    Redundant Slice Initialization (resArr := []int{})
        Instead of initializing resArr as an empty slice, declare it as var resArr []int, which avoids unnecessary memory allocation.

    Naming Consistency & Readability
        The variable name ch is misleading since it suggests a character type. Use num instead.
