Code Review & Issues
✅ Correct Logic

    The function correctly implements a two-pointer approach to check for a palindrome.
    It properly ignores non-alphabetic characters while processing.

⚠ Issues & Improvements

    Does Not Handle Upper and Lower Case Correctly
        The function compares characters in a case-sensitive way, meaning "Racecar" would return false since 'R' != 'r'.
        Fix: Convert both characters to lowercase before comparison.

    Non-Alphanumeric Filtering Ignores Digits (0-9)
        The function only considers letters (A-Z, a-z), ignoring digits.
        If you intend to include numeric characters (e.g., "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" should return true), update the filtering condition.

    Unnecessary Helper Function (isSame)
        The isSame function is redundant, as char1 == char2 can be directly used in the main function.


Key Fixes & Enhancements

✅ Handles Upper & Lower Case Correctly – Uses unicode.ToLower(rune(...)) for case-insensitive comparison.
✅ Supports Numeric Characters – The function now considers digits (0-9).
✅ Avoids Unnecessary Helper Function – Removed isSame, using direct comparison instead.
✅ More Readable Filtering – Moved non-alphanumeric checks to a dedicated isAlphaNumeric function.
✅ Efficient Iteration – The function ensures each character is processed at most once (O(n)).
