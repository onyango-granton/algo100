Your function aims to find a pair of numbers in arr that sum to target and return their indices. However, there are multiple issues with your implementation:
Issues:

    Incorrect Pair Checking (intMap[intMap[x]])
        You're trying to check if the complement exists by looking up intMap[intMap[x]], which is incorrect and causes a KeyError if intMap[x] is not a key.
        The correct approach is to check if intMap[x] exists in intMap (or in arr).

    Logical Errors in Finding Indices
        while x < 2 is redundant since x is not updated in a meaningful way.
        The loop for appending indices is inefficient and will likely not work as intended.

    Unnecessary Data Structures
        intMap is used in a way that doesnâ€™t add much value.
        intList is unnecessary; you can return the indices directly.
        indexList is overcomplicated.
