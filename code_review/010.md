It seems there are a couple of issues with your code that can be addressed to improve its functionality:
bubblesort function:

    Duplicate variable x in nested loops: The same variable x is being used in both loops. This could lead to unexpected behavior, and you should use a different variable name for the inner loop to avoid overwriting the outer loop's value.

    Inefficient loop bounds: You don't need to loop through the entire array in every iteration of the outer loop. The array will already be sorted up to the last unsorted element after each pass.
