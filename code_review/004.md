Here's a review of your removeDuplicates function with suggestions for improvements:
1. Logic of Handling Duplicates:

The logic you're using to remove duplicates seems to have an issue. You're appending elements to arr inside the loop. However, this approach increases the array's size and doesn't properly remove duplicates, especially when pointer is set to the first element (arr[0]), and you're checking for new unique elements.

Suggested Fix:

    Use a map to track unique elements. This is the most efficient way to remove duplicates without modifying the array during iteration.

2. Inefficient Appending:

Appending to the array inside a loop will cause reallocations every time, which can lead to performance issues. Instead, create a new slice and append only unique elements to it.
3. Pointer Usage:

You don't need the pointer variable for comparison. Instead, compare the current element with the last added element in the result slice (or a map).
4. Returning the Array Slice:

You are returning arr[stop+1:], which is slicing the array starting from stop+1 until the end. This approach is unnecessary because you can directly return the new slice containing unique elements.



## CODE REVIEW OF POINTERS
Both functions are designed to remove duplicates from an array, and their core logic is similar. However, there are differences in how the result slice is handled, and this leads to different implications for time complexity and performance.
Comparison of the two functions:
1. Memory Allocation and Slice Handling:

    First function (using a pointer to a slice):

result := &[]int{}

    You are using a pointer to a slice (&[]int{}). This means every time you append to *result, you are modifying the original slice. The slice itself is not allocated in the standard stack memory; it's indirectly pointing to the heap memory.
    Appending using append(*result, num) creates a new slice every time the slice needs more capacity, which can incur extra overhead, especially if the slice grows a lot.

Second function (direct slice assignment):

    result := []int{}

        You create a slice normally ([]int{}). When you append to result, Go handles reallocations internally without needing to use pointers.
        Appending happens directly to the result slice, and the slice grows as needed, without the extra indirection of dereferencing a pointer.

2. Performance (Big-O Complexity):

    Time Complexity: Both functions have the same O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input array. This is because they both iterate through the input array once, checking and appending elements.
        The append operation is amortized O(1) because of how Go manages slice capacity internally, although it can occasionally be O(n) when the slice grows beyond its capacity.
    Space Complexity: Both functions also have the same O(n) space complexity, because they both store the result in a new slice and use a map to track unique elements.
        The space usage for the seen map is O(n) in the worst case, and the result slice also grows to store the unique elements.

3. Memory Efficiency and Extra Overhead:

    First function (pointer to slice):
        The slice is a pointer, so there is an extra level of indirection (*result) when accessing and modifying the slice.
        This may incur a small additional memory overhead because you are working with a pointer to a slice rather than a direct slice, although in most cases, this is negligible.
        There is also a chance of increased heap allocation due to the pointer, which can add slight overhead for larger arrays, although the time complexity is still O(n).
    Second function (direct slice):
        The second version avoids the extra indirection and directly manipulates the slice, making it more idiomatic Go.
        It is generally easier to understand and results in slightly fewer instructions, as there is no need to dereference a pointer.

Summary of Differences:
Aspect	First Function (Pointer to Slice)	Second Function (Direct Slice)
Slice Type	Pointer to a slice (&[]int{})	Direct slice ([]int{})
Memory Allocation	Potentially higher overhead with pointer dereferencing	More efficient, no pointer dereferencing
Performance (Time Complexity)	O(n)	O(n)
Performance (Space Complexity)	O(n)	O(n)
Memory Efficiency	Potentially higher memory usage due to pointer overhead	More efficient in terms of memory usage
Code Clarity	Less idiomatic (use of pointer)	More idiomatic and simpler to read
Conclusion:

    Second function (direct slice) is generally better because it is more idiomatic, easier to understand, and slightly more efficient in terms of memory usage.
    First function (pointer to slice) may have some edge cases where the extra pointer indirection introduces unnecessary complexity. It also introduces extra overhead when dereferencing.

For these reasons, the second function is preferred in Go.
