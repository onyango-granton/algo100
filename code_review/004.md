Here's a review of your removeDuplicates function with suggestions for improvements:
1. Logic of Handling Duplicates:

The logic you're using to remove duplicates seems to have an issue. You're appending elements to arr inside the loop. However, this approach increases the array's size and doesn't properly remove duplicates, especially when pointer is set to the first element (arr[0]), and you're checking for new unique elements.

Suggested Fix:

    Use a map to track unique elements. This is the most efficient way to remove duplicates without modifying the array during iteration.

2. Inefficient Appending:

Appending to the array inside a loop will cause reallocations every time, which can lead to performance issues. Instead, create a new slice and append only unique elements to it.
3. Pointer Usage:

You don't need the pointer variable for comparison. Instead, compare the current element with the last added element in the result slice (or a map).
4. Returning the Array Slice:

You are returning arr[stop+1:], which is slicing the array starting from stop+1 until the end. This approach is unnecessary because you can directly return the new slice containing unique elements.
