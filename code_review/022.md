Code Review: Fibonacci Function
Issues and Improvements:

    Incorrect Base Case for n = 0
        The Fibonacci sequence typically starts with 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, ..., meaning fibonacci(0) = 0, not 1.
        Correct base cases should be:

    if num == 0 {
        return 0
    }
    if num == 1 {
        return 1
    }

Performance Issues: Exponential Time Complexity (O(2^n))

    The function recalculates Fibonacci numbers multiple times, leading to redundant computations.
    Using memoization (storing previously computed results) can improve efficiency.

Better Readability

    Instead of two separate if conditions, combine them into a switch statement for better readability.

Code Review: Issues & Fixes 🚀

Your Python implementation of Fibonacci with memoization has a critical issue:
👉 The memo dictionary resets every function call because it's defined inside the function. This prevents memoization from working correctly.
Key Issues

❌ Memoization doesn't persist – memo is reinitialized on every call, losing stored values.
❌ Inefficient performance – The function still behaves like an exponential recursion (O(2ⁿ)).
❌ Misses Pythonic best practices – Should use lru_cache or pass memo explicitly.
