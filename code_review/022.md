Code Review: Fibonacci Function
Issues and Improvements:

    Incorrect Base Case for n = 0
        The Fibonacci sequence typically starts with 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, ..., meaning fibonacci(0) = 0, not 1.
        Correct base cases should be:

    if num == 0 {
        return 0
    }
    if num == 1 {
        return 1
    }

Performance Issues: Exponential Time Complexity (O(2^n))

    The function recalculates Fibonacci numbers multiple times, leading to redundant computations.
    Using memoization (storing previously computed results) can improve efficiency.

Better Readability

    Instead of two separate if conditions, combine them into a switch statement for better readability.
