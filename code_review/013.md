Issues and Improvements:
1. Variable Naming Conflict (max and min)


    max and min are built-in functions in Python, and overriding them can cause unexpected behavior.
    Use different names, like max_num and min_num.

✅ Fix:

max_num, min_num = arr[0], arr[0]

2. Finding Min & Max Can Be Optimized

Instead of manually iterating to find the min and max values:


We can use Python’s built-in max() and min():


✅ Fix:

max_num, min_num = max(arr), min(arr)

This makes the code cleaner and more efficient.
3. Inefficient List Usage



    This creates an unnecessary extra list with potentially a large size.
    Instead of using an array to track presence, we can use a set, which is more memory-efficient.

✅ Fix:


4. Returning the Missing Number


    This assumes that the missing number will always be in the range [min, max], but what if the missing number is outside the given array’s range?
    Instead, loop through numbers from min_num to max_num and return the missing one.
